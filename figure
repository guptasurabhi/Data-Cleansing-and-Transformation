Problem description
XYZ Credit union in Latin America is performing very well in selling Banking products (Credit card , deposit amount, retirement account, safe deposit box), but their existing customer is not buying more  than 1 product which means bank is not performing good in cross selling (Banks is not able to sell their other offering to existing customers). XYZ credit union decided to approach ABC analytics to solve their problem.
